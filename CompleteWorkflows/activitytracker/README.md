# activitytracker

Use a job template to deploy a project to an edge server.

This example processes GPS data from activity tracker devices worn by players in a football match. The example demonstrates how you can publish a project in SAS Event Stream Processing Studio to make it available in SAS Event Stream Manager, and then use a job template in SAS Event Stream Manager to deploy the project to an edge server.

SAS Help Center contains step-by-step instructions about how to use the example files. For more information, see [Activity Tracker Example](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=espcdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=esmuse&docsetTarget=n1t6getpw1ayjvn1fqwxi6wvm07u.htm).
